# Data_Mining_ProteinDataBank-Python
This is an example to use BioPython to extract 3D geometric data of specific ligand-protein interactions. 
The input file "ccl_ethane_benzene_res3.0.sheet" includes those refined PDBid provided from Protein Data Bank
The resulting information of each type of interaction will be writtin in results folder. <br>
